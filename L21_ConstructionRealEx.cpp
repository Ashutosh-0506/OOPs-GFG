The meaning of the verse is :—
You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to
inaction

/*
Let us understand the types of constructors in C++ by taking a real-world example. Suppose you went to a shop to buy a marker.
When you want to buy a marker, what are the options.
The first one you go to a shop and say give me a marker.
So just saying give me a marker mean that you did not set which brand name and which color,
you didn’t mention anything just say you want a marker.
So when we said just I want a marker so whatever the frequently sold marker is there in the market or in his shop he will simply hand over that.
And this is what a default constructor is! The second method is you go to a shop and say I want a marker a red in color and XYZ brand.
So you are mentioning this and he will give you that marker. So in this case you have given the parameters.
And this is what a parameterized constructor is! Then the third one you go to a shop and say I want a marker like this(a physical marker on your hand).
So the shopkeeper will see that marker.
 Okay, and he will give a new marker for you. So copy of that marker. And that’s what a copy constructor is!
